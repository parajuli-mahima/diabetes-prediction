# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is likely to have
diabetes based on medical and health-related features. The analysis
uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine
learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## Dataset

* Medical dataset containing health indicators such as:

  * Glucose level
  * Blood pressure
  * BMI
  * Insulin
  * Age
* Data is preprocessed to handle missing or invalid values.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature scaling
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Prediction and result analysis

## Outcome

The model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input
health parameters and demonstrates the use of machine learning
in healthcare data analysis.

## Future Improvements

* Try advanced classification models
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Improve feature selection
